# What Do

## Why

There are existing tools, but I want to build something:

* Designed around a plug-able core
* Completely future facing: Only Python ≥ 3.5, type annotation
* With an idiomatic OO class structure, hexagonal architecture (port/adapter)
* Small enough to be achievable
* Genuinely useful (?)
